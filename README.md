*** Process of data flow pipeline *** 
Apps works with next.js and react - where next js manages server side actions and react manage ui how it looks like or how user interaction and response comes on ui level and user get response as data, login, auth, or any ui looks. 
    So the concept is - trying to add more load to server side and reduce load to dom/ user agent so user browser gets light weight. When we think about the performance of user side or different configuration of devices, the process gives a better performance on the ui or browser side.

*** Design of Contents jsx ***
So whee page jsx takes full html content and most of the part as like a frame and when user intend to visualize / see data then data comes from server through content as page jsx child. So when the intend comes that time the call comes fro dom to server through react, so building react fiber sometimes waste but client side load should lighter. 

*** Contents *** 
Contents keeps all ui which are related with topics of development Approach but only the ui structure, how & who keep data and looks of ui but no data its actualy carries. When user intend comes from dom that times datat comes from server to react to dom. So it keeps browser so light. And there are three ui contains Contents jsx but its depending what content user asking that data only passing on that data pipeline. Sso server only carries one content data at a time.
