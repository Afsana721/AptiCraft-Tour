        "Design‑First, Server‑Side Application Development Design‑first, server‑side application development focuses on thinking clearly about the final outcome before writing UI or client code. The objective is to decide early where logic belongs, how data flows, and how much work the user device must handle. In this approach, heavy computation, validation, business rules, and decision‑making stay on the server, while the client or UI remains lightweight and focused on rendering and interaction. This reduces browser load, improves performance on low‑end devices, increases security, and ensures consistent behavior across platforms.",
        "Connected System Design A well‑designed system works as a connected chain rather than isolated parts. The desired outcome defines the architecture; architecture shapes data design; data design drives interfaces; interfaces define components; and the UI reflects system decisions instead of making them. Because each layer depends on the others, a change in one area affects the entire system, making holistic design essential.",
        "Standard Development Process (SDLC) Planning → Analysis → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance s cycle ensures clarity, quality, and continuous improvement as the system evolves."
